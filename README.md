Particle and CMake with Conan
===

This is a collection of Conan packages providing the build configuration to support Particle firmware development with CMake.

A continuation of the proof of concept [cmake-particle-firmware](https://github.com/jw3/cmake-particle-firmware), this is also somewhat of a proof of concept but will be longer lived. A roadmap is in the works.

Packages are published to https://bintray.com/jw3/particle

Supports v2 and v3 boards (photon, electron, argon, boron, xenon)
